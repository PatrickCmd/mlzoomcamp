## 13. Article

The best way to learn about something - to teach it.

In this part of the course, we'll explore some topics that weren't 
covered in the course.

You'll need to learn about this topic and then write about what
you learned in an article. (Of course if you already know something
and just want to share your knowledge with us - it's also fine
and more than welcome.)
