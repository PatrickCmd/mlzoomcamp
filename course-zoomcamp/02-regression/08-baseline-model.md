## Notes

* In this lesson we build a baseline model and apply the `df_train` dataset to derive weights for the bias (w0) and the features (w). For this, we use the `train_linear_regression(X, y)` function from the previous lesson.
* Linear regression only applies to numerical features. Therefore, only the numerical features from `df_train` are used for the feature matrix. 
* We notice some of the features in `df_train` are `nan`. We set them to `0` for the sake of simplicity, so the model is solvable, but it will be appropriate if a non-zeo value is used as the filler (e.g. mean value of the feature).
* Once the weights are calculated, then we apply them on  $$\\\\ \large g(X) = w_0 + X \cdot w$$ to derive the predicted y vector.
* Then we plot both predicted y and the actual y on the same histogram for a visual comparison.
