## Notes

In this session we'll learn about decision trees and ensemble learning algorithms. How we can implement and fine-tune these models to make binary classification predictions.

To be specific, we'll use [credit scoring data](https://github.com/gastonstat/CreditScoring) to make model predictions whether the bank should lend the loan to the client or not. The bank makes these decisions based on the historical record.

In the credit scoring classification problem, if the model returns 0 that means the status is `ok` and the client will payback and if the probability is 1 then its the `default` client.
