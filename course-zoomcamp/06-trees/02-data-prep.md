## Notes

In this section we clean and prepare the [dataset](https://github.com/gastonstat/CreditScoring/raw/master/CreditScoring.csv) for the model which involves the following steps:

- Download the data from the given link.
- Reformat categorical columns (`status`, `home`, `marital`, `records`, and `job`) by mapping with appropriate values.
- Replace the maximum value of `income`, `assests`, and `debt` columns with NaNs.
- Replace the NaNs in the dataframe with `0` (*will be shown in the next lesson*).
- Extract only those rows in the column `status` who are either ok or default as value.
- Split the data in a two-step process which finally leads to the distribution of 60% train, 20% validation, and 20% test sets with random seed to `11`.
- Prepare target variable `status` by converting it from categorical to binary, where 0 represents `ok` and 1 represents `default`.
- Finally delete the target variable from the train/val/test dataframe.
