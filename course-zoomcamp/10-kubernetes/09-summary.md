In the session 10 we covered the following concepts:

- TF-Serving is a system for deploying TensorFlow models
- When using TF-Serving, we need a component for pre-processing
- Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform
- To deploy something on Kubernetes, we need to specify a deployment and a service
- You can use Docker compose and Kind for local experiments
